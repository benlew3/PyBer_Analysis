# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
### Description:
V. Isualize has tasked myself and a colleague on creating a summary of the ride-share data. We are to create multiple line graphs that shows the total weekly fares per each city type. 

### Purpose:
My job is to clean up the data and place into readable graphs and statistic sheets. 

### Situation
We want to identify what city type performse best at what fare rate. We want to know what are the differences between Urban, Suburban and Rural citiy types. We will be looking at fare cost, how many riders per city type and how many drivers we have in each city type.

### Approach:
We will be using Matplotlib, Pandas and Python in order to clean the data to look at the statistics.
